## üöÄ Foreword

Dot Browser is proud to be powered by Firefox and Gecko. 

There are a plethora of Chromium based browsers available and introducing competition is unique, healthy, and necessary in the browser space. 

We chose Gecko due to its position as the best competitor to Chromium, and because it‚Äôs developed by Mozilla, who are best known for their privacy efforts in the community.
